# PatchFuzz
The code for our paper: "PatchFuzz: An Efficient Way to Incorporate Patching with Hybrid Fuzzing".

It is now available for some Linux architecture. See the [afl-other-arch](https://github.com/shellphish/afl-other-arch) repository for specific supported architectures.

This project is built on [afl-other-arch](https://github.com/shellphish/afl-other-arch), [QSYM](https://github.com/sslab-gatech/qsym) and [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra).



## Build PatchFuzz

First, make sure that you have installed docker. We do not test our code ouside docker since it rely on QSYM.



### Build QSYM

1. clone the repository of QSYM

```
git clone https://github.com/sslab-gatech/qsym.git
```

2. build qsym docker as guided in [QSYM](https://github.com/sslab-gatech/qsym)

```
echo 0|sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
cd qsym/
docker build -t qsym ./
```

If you cannot install pip correctly during setup.sh(maybe due to network issue), you can comment out the line "RUN pip install ." with "#" and do it yourself after you are inside the docker container.

3. run the container

```
docker run --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -it qsym /bin/bash
```

4. finish what you comment in step 2 if you do

```
cd /workdir/qsym
pip install .
```



### Build PatchFuzz

1. clone our repository inside the docker

```
git clone https://github.com/RongxiYe/PatchFuzz.git
```

2. or, if the network does not work well, clone the repository outside the docker and copy it into the container（need root）

```
#clone ouside docker
docker cp PatchFuzz/ <your_container_id>:/patchfuzz
```

3. build patchfuzz-AFL

```
cd /patchfuzz
make clean
make
```

If it builds successfully, you will see afl-fuzz in the directory.

4. build qemu-mode

```
sudo apt-get install libtool-bin automake bison libglib2.0-dev
cd qemu_mode
tar -xf qemu-2.10.0.tar 
./build_qemu_support.sh <ARCHES>
```



### Build Ghidra

1. download ghidra release(we use 10.0.4) in [ghidra build](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_10.4_build)  and unzip it inside docker.
2. set env "GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR" as where you put ghidra build.

```
export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<xx/ghidra_10.4_PUBLIC/>
```

3. install java 17(maybe need root, and the time may be a bit long)

```
apt-get install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
apt update
apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```

4. update python3 to 3.8 or later(Do this after you installed java!!!)

```
add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.5 1
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 <path to your newly added python> 2

#change python:
update-alternatives --config python3
```

​      If you encounter a problem that "lsb_release -a" does not work, try:

```
#add lsb_release
ln -s /usr/share/pyshared/lsb_release.py <path to lib of your newly added python>/lsb_release.py
```

5. install pyhidra

```
python3 -m pip install pyhidra
```

6. check if ghidra is successfully installed:

```
cd /patchfuzz
python3 ghidra/ghidra_analyze.py  <target binary>
```

7. !!rebase problem: see "rebase_offset" in ghidra_analyze.py. The default base is 0x400000. If you need to test binaries on other architectures, make sure to set the correct base address in "rebase_offset".



## Run PatchFuzz

PatchFuzz has two parts: AFL and QSYM. You need to first start afl-fuzz in one shell window and run QSYM in another shell window. You can use tmux to run in the background.

### Run PatchFuzz-AFL

see run.sh and its inside comments.

example:

```
cd /patchfuzz
./run.sh $PWD <path to seed dir> <your afl workdir> <path to tested binary>
```

NOTE: Sometimes you need to modify run.sh. For the content after $AFL_CMDLINE in run.sh, please follow the rules of AFL. Use @@ for file input.

For example, if the tested binary requires input like:

```
base64 -d <a file>
```

The run.sh script should be like:

```
$AFL_ROOT/afl-fuzz -m none -M afl-master -i $INPUT -o $OUTPUT -Q -- $AFL_CMDLINE -d @@
```

NOTE2: You may need to initiate the running environment for AFL using root:

```
echo core >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
echo performance | tee cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

NOTE3：\<your afl workdir\> should be a folder that does not exist currently.





### Run QSYM

see run_symbolic.sh and its inside comments.

You need to start this scripts AFTER you see AFL panel in the other window!!!!

example:

```
cd /patchfuzz
./run_symbolic.sh <path to tested binary> <your afl workdir>
```

NOTE: If you modify run.sh for the arguments of the tested binary, you need to modify /patchfuzz/symbolic/symbolic.py. Search "cmd" and add the arguments there. For example, for base64, it would be:

```
cmd = [binary , '-d', '@@']
```



### Directories

real_crash: true positive

candidate_crash: for manual analysis

patches: all patch information files

crashes: all crashes containing four components，which are the corresponding seed，and three patch information files

hangs: same as crashes dir, only for hangs



## Analysis scripts

We develop a set of analysis scripts to help manually screen false positives.

### test_crash.sh and test_with_gdb

1. **build shellphish-qemu-linux** 

```
cd /patchfuzz/scripts/shellphish-qemu-linux 
make clean
./buildme.sh
```

You can also modify your wanted architecture in buildme.sh.

```
../configure --target-list=i386-linux-user,x86_64-linux-user,<other arch>
```

If it is successfully build, you can find the "qemu-xxx" of the corresponding architecture under "build/".

2. Make sure that you have installed **gdb or gdb-multiarch** for other archs.

3. **test the results**: modify test_crash.sh according to the tested program's need. You need two shell windows. One for qemu, and another for gdb.

If you want to test the result of a binary that accepts inputs using IO stream and without arguments:

```
#modify test_crash.sh
cat $file |  timeout -k 3 3 /patchfuzz/scripts/shellphish-qemu-linux/build/<arch>-linux-user/qemu-<arch> -P $file.patch -g 12345 $1
```

```
#run test_crash.sh
/patchfuzz/scripts/test_crash.sh <path to your tested binary> <path to your afl workdir> 
```

The other window:

```
#modify test_with_gdb.py to your ip
target remote <ip>:12345 
```

run gdb:

```
gdb <path to your tested binary>

#after you enter gdb
#set architecture <arch> (if you use gdb-multiarch)
source /patchfuzz/scripts/test_with_gdb.py
# enter <path to your afl workdir> as guided
```

Remember to start gdb window FIRST and enter \<path to your afl workdir\>. Then you need to start test_crash.sh immediately.



For test_crash.sh: 

If the binary accepts inputs using IO stream and WITH arguments:

```
cat $file |  timeout -k 3 3 /patchfuzz/scripts/shellphish-qemu-linux/build/<arch>-linux-user/qemu-<arch> -P $file.patch -g 12345 $1 <your arguments>
```

For example, 

```
cat $file |  timeout -k 3 3 /patchfuzz/scripts/shellphish-qemu-linux/build/<arch>-linux-user/qemu-<arch> -P $file.patch -g 12345 $1 -d
```

If it accepts a file input without arguments, then:

```
timeout -k 3 3 /patchfuzz/scripts/shellphish-qemu-linux/build/<arch>-linux-user/qemu-<arch> -P $file.patch -g 12345 $1 $file
```

If it accepts a file input with arguments, then:

``` 
timeout -k 3 3 /patchfuzz/scripts/shellphish-qemu-linux/build/<arch>-linux-user/qemu-<arch> -P $file.patch -g 12345 $1 -d $file
```



4. **result interpretation**

data.xlsx: Each column represents a different unique crash. The first three rows represent the backtrace, register information, and the total number of identical crashes recorded during the crash. All the rows below are the specific crash numbers under those folders, providing reference for later analysis.

hijacked.txt: number of control flow hijacking



### advanced_test_one.sh

It is used to test a specific seed separately. You can choose to remove some patch points and test on the target program.
